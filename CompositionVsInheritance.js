/**
 *  1. The problem with the inheritance is to inheritate lots of things you dont need
 *  
 *  2. "You request the banana, but you get a gorilla holding the banana and the whole jungle with it"
 * 
 *  3. Inheritance is when you design your types around on what they ARE
 * 
 *  4. Composition is when you design your types around on what they DO
 * 
 *  5. You should FAVOR composition over inheritance. Its is more flexible, more powerful
 *  and easy to do
 * 
 *  6. Inheritance is NOT a good pattern and it should not be used, acctually avoided
 * 
 *  7. Inheritance leads to future design problems. Because humans CANNOT predict the future
